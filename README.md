# Mental Health Risk Classification

This repository outlines a general framework for classifying mental health risk levels. The classification is commonly used in educational, clinical-support, research, and workplace contexts to support awareness, documentation, and decision-making.

## Overview

Mental health risk refers to the likelihood that an individual may experience harm to themselves or others due to psychological distress. Risk levels are typically assessed based on emotional state, thoughts of self-harm, coping ability, protective factors, and functional impairment.

This framework divides risk into four levels: **Low**, **Moderate**, **High**, and **Imminent**.

## Risk Levels

### Low Risk
Characterized by mild or temporary emotional distress, such as stress or low mood. There are no thoughts of self-harm, and the individual demonstrates effective coping strategies and strong protective factors, including social support and problem-solving skills. Daily functioning is largely unaffected.

### Moderate Risk
Involves ongoing emotional distress that begins to interfere with daily activities. The individual may experience passive thoughts of self-harm without intent or planning. Coping capacity may be reduced, and protective factors may be inconsistent or limited.

### High Risk
Defined by active thoughts of self-harm or suicide, possibly accompanied by intent, planning, or access to means. Symptoms may be severe, such as major depression, psychosis, or substance misuse. Protective factors are minimal, and functioning is significantly impaired. Urgent professional support is required.

### Imminent / Acute Risk
Represents an emergency situation where there is clear intent to cause harm, a specific plan, and immediate access to means. The individual may be unable to maintain personal safety and requires immediate intervention.
