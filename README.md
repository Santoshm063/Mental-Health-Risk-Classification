Mental health risk may be classified as low (mild distress with good coping and no harm thoughts), moderate (ongoing distress and passive self-harm thoughts), high (active self-harm thoughts with possible intent or plan), or imminent (clear intent, plan, and immediate risk requiring emergency action).
